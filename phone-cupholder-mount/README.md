# Phone Cupholder Mount

[Thingiverse Link](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1107476)

I built this cup-holder phone mount for the following specifications:

* Fit nice and snug in a Mini Cooper Cupholder
* Should work with both an iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus
* Should have a hole to get a cable fit into it and should have space for a [Lightning to 30-pin Adapter](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD823AM/A/lightning-to-30-pin-adapter) in the bottom

The model was built with [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org) -- this is my first time ever using OpenSCAD so feedback is very welcome! Either way it is highly parametric, so it should be easy to customize to other configurations.
